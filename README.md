# Adversarial Shortest Path

An AI build to compete in a class competition at NYU. More details about the game [here](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/fall16/CSCI-GA.2965-001/advshort.html).

### Strategy

The AI tries to cluster nodes based on reachability to find the smallest group of reachable nodes as late in the path as possible. Then, we double costs on those nodes.
